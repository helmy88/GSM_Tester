Arduino GSM Module Test

Description:
This project demonstrates how to test the GSM condition using an Arduino and a SIM800L GSM module. It establishes communication with the module and prints the response to the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.

Hardware Requirements:
1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
2. SIM800L GSM module
3. Active GSM SIM card with a compatible subscription
4. Jumper wires for connections

Connections:
- Connect the TX pin of the SIM800L module to Arduino's digital pin 7 (sim800lTxPin).
- Connect the RX pin of the SIM800L module to Arduino's digital pin 8 (sim800lRxPin).
- Power the SIM800L module using an external power supply.

Instructions:
1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor to monitor the SIM800L module's responses.
3. The module will initialize, and you will see the response in the Serial Monitor.
4. The GSM condition can be checked by observing the responses from the module.

Note:
- Ensure you have a working SIM card with an active GSM subscription inserted into the SIM800L module.
- Make sure to provide an external power supply to the SIM800L module if it requires one.
